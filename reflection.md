- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
Encapsulation can be challenging to put the different strings and methods into each individual classes to "package", but once they are done right, I think it is very convinient as it prevents other users from accessing all of the data and overwriting it.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I don't notice any errors in my code (not that I can tell by looking at it simply), but my project does not run. After asking main to compile all of the classes, my project does not fully run (for example, the getoffTrain part is not executed in my code, but it displays when I use another source such as Replit for example). I am having trouble running this code and figuring out the classpath.
Aside from this issue, I am glad I was able to understand how to use the various methods from different classes and implement them into the main call.
